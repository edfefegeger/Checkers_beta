# Checkers_beta
The project completely repeats the original checkers game. It works together with the QT graphical interface. The game has a main menu, a main menu with a playing field, a finish (and on it the final calculation of the results). At the moment, only one game system is implemented, this is directly on one PC, in the future I plan to add a network game.
